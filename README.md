# Welcome to CashFair

CashFair is a JavaFx program that simulates a payment app, allowing users to pay by spreading the cost by a percentage, this makes it perfect for,

## Getting Started
To get started clone the repository and make sure that you import the project in an updated IDE and compatible with Maven projects.
