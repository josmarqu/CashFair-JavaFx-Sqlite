# CashFair

CashFair is a JavaFx program that simulates a payment app, allowing users to pay by spreading the cost by a percentage, this makes it perfect for,
for example, paying for a dinner with friends.
Also a sqlite data base is included, this allows to see the history of payments made with the money and percentage paid by each one.
